    <h1>More Semantic HTML Practice</h1>

      <h2>Today's In-Class Activity</h2>
      <p>Today we'll practice more with semantic HTML for marking up text, as well as grouping content by topic and using headings to help the user know what the topics on your page are. Remember, the HTML you add to your pages tells the user (and search engines) the kind of content they're going to find.</p>

      <p>Follow the steps below to complete this activity:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Add your name to the meta author tag above.</li>
        <li>Open this file in your browser so you can view and test it while we code.</li>
        <li>Review this file and its content to get a better idea of what will be on the final page.</li>
        <li>Some of the tags have been added for you to help you see how this content could be marked up semantically. Follow along in class as we add the rest of the tags to the page.</li>
        <li>While we work, save your file and refresh it in the browser often to ensure that it is loading as expected.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Basic Text Tags</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><code>p</code> – for paragraph text, usually multiple lines</li>
        <li><code>em</code> – for text that needs to be emphasized in some way (this adds meaning)</li>
        <li><code>strong</code> – for important text (this adds meaning)</li>
        <li><code>cite</code> – for the title of a work</li>
        <li><code>mark</code> – marked or highlighted text (this adds meaning)</li>
        <li><code>b</code> – text that needs attention but isn't important or a heading</li>
        <li><code>i</code> – text in an alternative voice</li>
        <li><code>u</code> – text that should appear differently than normal text, underlined by default</li>
        <li><code>kbd</code> – for keyboard input</li>
        <li><code>samp</code> – for sample output from a computer</li>
        <li><code>var</code> – for variables in a computer program</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tags for Grouping and Describing Content</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><code>h1</code> – the most important heading, only use one per page</li>
        <li><code>h2</code> – the second level of heading</li>
        <li><code>h3</code> – third level of heading for sub-topics</li>
        <li><code>h4</code> – fourth level of heading for sub-topics of level 3 headings</li>
        <li><code>h5</code> – fifth level of heading for sub-topics of level 4 headings</li>
        <li><code>h6</code> – sixth level of heading for sub-topics of level 5 headings</li>
        <li><code>section</code> – container for grouping related content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Headings have specific uses, and they don't have anything to do with how they look. We use headings the way you would use an outline to map out topics for a paper. Think in terms of the main topic, sub-topics of that, and even sub-topics for more levels after that, up to six levels. A container will never have more than one heading inside of it.</p>

      <h2>Special Characters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><code>&copy;</code> – the copyright symbol</li>
        <li><code>&nbsp;</code> – the non-breaking space symbol</li>
        <li><code>&amp;</code> – the ampersand</li>
        <li><code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> – the less than and greater than characters</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These special characters come in handy on the web. Some characters are things that you can't just type out on your computer, while others replace characters that could break your code. They can add formatting (like in the case of a non-breaking space), but they should not be used to replace CSS.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Lists</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><code>ol</code> – for ordered lists, or a list of steps that need to be completed in an order</li>
        <li><code>ul</code> – unordered (bulleted) lists</li>
        <li><code>li</code> – an individual list item inside a list</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Throughout this page, we use lists to give a list of the tags related to the topic given by the heading in each section. Lists can be very useful, as there is plenty of content that is displayed in a list format, but they also help accessibility.</p>
